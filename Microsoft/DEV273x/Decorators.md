# Decorators

A Decorator is a special kind of declaration that can be attached to a class declaration, method, accessor, property, or parameter.

Sometimes it is required to have additional features to support annotating or modifying classes and class members. Decorators provide a way to add both annotations and a meta-programming syntax for class declarations and members.

Decorators are a stage 2 proposal for JavaScript and are available as an experimental feature of TypeScript.

    NOTEâ€ƒ Decorators are an experimental feature that may change in future releases of Typescript.

Decorators use the form @expression, where expression must evaluate to a function that will be called at runtime with information about the decorated declaration.

Check the tutorial lab about Applying a Decorator in this module for more details about decorators.
